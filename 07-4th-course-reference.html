<!-- "Forms" - savāc informāciju, lai nosūtītu uz HTTP serveri. -->
<!-- We can think of the internet as a network of computers which send and receive information. Computers need an HTTP request to know how to communicate. The HTTP request instructs the receiving computer how to handle the incoming information. More information can be found in our article about HTTP requests.

The <form> element is a great tool for collecting information, but then we need to send that information somewhere else for processing. We need to supply the <form> element with both the location of where the <form>‘s information goes and what HTTP request to make. Take a look at the sample <form> below:

<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
</form>
In the above example, we’ve created the skeleton for a <form> that will send information to example.html as a POST request:

The action attribute determines where the information is sent.
The method attribute is assigned a HTTP verb that is included in the HTTP request.
Note: HTTP verbs like POST do not need to be capitalized for the request to work, but it’s done so out of convention. In the example above we could have written method="post" and it would still work.

The <form> element can also contain child elements. For instance, it would be helpful to provide a header so that users know what this <form> is about. We could also add a paragraph to provide even more detail.-->

<!-- HTML FORMS
Text Input
If we want to create an input field in our <form>, we’ll need the help of the <input> element.

The <input> element has a type attribute which determines how it renders on the web page and what kind of data it can accept.

The first value for the type attribute we’re going to explore is "text". When we create an <input> element with type="text", it renders a text field that users can type into. Note that the default value of type is "text". It’s also important that we include a name attribute for the <input> — without the name attribute, information in the <input> won’t be sent when the <form> is submitted. We’ll explain more about submissions and the submit button in a later exercise. For now, let’s examine the following code that produces a text input field:

<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="first-text-field">
</form>
Here’s a screen shot of how the rendered form looks like on a web page for the Chrome browser (different browsers have different default rendering). When initially loaded, it will be an empty box:

rendered empty text field from input element type='text'
After users type into the <input> element, the value of the value attribute becomes what is typed into the text field. The value of the value attribute is paired with the value of the name attribute and sent as text when the form is submitted. For instance, if a user typed in “important details” in the text field created by our <input> element:

rendered filled text field which reads 'important details' 
When the form is submitted, the text: "first-text-field=important details" is sent to /example.html because the value of the name attribute is "first-text-field" and the value of value is "important details".

We could also assign a default value for the value attribute so that users have a pre-filled text field when they first see the rendered form like so:

<form action="/example.html" method="POST">
  <input type="text" name="first-text-field" value="already pre-filled">
</form>
Which renders:

pre-filled text box due to assigned `value` attribute -->
<!-- Password/username boxes.-->
<!-- <h1>Login to start creating a burger!</h1>
        <label for="username">Username:</label>
  			<input type="text" name="username" id="username">
        <br>
        <label for="user-pw">Password:</label>
				<input id="user-pw" type="password" name="user-pw">-->

<!-- Number input.
        <section class="patties">
          <label for="amount">How many patties would you like?</label>
					<input id="amount" type="number" step="1" name="amount">-->
