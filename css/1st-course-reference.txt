When linking an HTML file and a CSS file together, the <link> element will look like the following:

<link href='https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css' rel='stylesheet'>
Note that in the example above, the path to the stylesheet is a URL:

https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css
Specifying the path to the stylesheet using a URL is one way of linking a stylesheet.

If the CSS file is stored in the same directory as your HTML file, then you can specify a relative path instead of a URL, like so:

<link href='./style.css' rel='stylesheet'>
Using a relative path is very common way of linking a stylesheet.
