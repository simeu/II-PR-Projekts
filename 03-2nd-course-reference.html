<!-- HTML files require certain elements to set up the document properly.
We can let web browsers know that we are using HTML by starting our document with a document type declaration.-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- Anything between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code. 
Without these tags, it’s possible that browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code. -->

<!--The <head> element is part of this HTML metaphor. It goes above our <body> element.-->

<!-- A browser’s tab displays the title specified in the <title> tag. The <title> tag is always inside of the <head>. -->
